title: Networks 101
---

This is an introduction to computer networks, with a heavy slant on Cisco gear and software. Even though Cisco is the reigning king of enterprise networking gear, its products and solutions leave a lot to be desired, so we we also present open-source and Windows alternatives, whenever this makes sense.

Even though the material has been inspired from the CCNA exam topics, this course contains several topics more, and it does not aim to cover the CCNA exam topics completely.
