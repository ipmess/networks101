## Prerequisites

To understand many topics in networking, you will need to have a firm grasp of Numeral systems and conversions between them.  
In particular, you should be comfortable converting decimal (up to 300) to binary and hexadecimal on paper or in your mind, and vice versa.

For example, you should be able to calculate the following:

`223 = 0b11011111 = 0xDF`  
`53 = 0b110101 = 0x35`

### Required software

You will need the following software for learning computer networks:

* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
* [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) (requires Broadcom account)

You should install VMware Workstation Pro if you are running Windows, or VMware Fusion if you are running on a Mac. Furthermore, you need a terminal emulator. If you are on Linux, you do not need anything extra apart from the default SSH client. For Windows, you will also need to get [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

After you have installed the above, you will need to install the following network simulators/emulators:

* [Cisco Modelling Labs](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286193282/type/286326381/release/2.8.0%20Free%20Tier) (requires a Cisco account)
* [GNS3](https://github.com/gns3/gns3-gui/releases) download the latest stable:
  - GNS3-x.y.z-all-in-one.exe if you are on Windows
  - GNS3.VM.VMware.Workstation.x.y.z.zip (make sure you have downloaded the GNS3 VM before you start the installation of the GNS3 GUI because the GNS3 VM is required during the installation)
* [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer). You need a Cisco NetAcad account and to enroll to the _Getting Started with Cisco Packet Tracer_ course to download this software.
